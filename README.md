User Story
AS A customer, I WANT to search for nearby 5 star rated restaurants/takeaways, with a location map, SO THAT I can choose which restaurant to go to based on my current location.

GIVEN I am a customer, WHEN I search for a specific restaurant name, THEN a list of restaurant/takeaway names, address, a map, and opening times appear.

WHEN I am not sure which restaurant to search for, I want to click pre-filtered buttons which give me a list of places to choose from.
